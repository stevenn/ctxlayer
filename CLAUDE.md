# ctxlayer — Claude Code Briefing

This repo is the **agent context layer**: a remote MCP server on Cloudflare that
serves curated docs (with RAG over Vectorize), proxies upstream MCP servers
with centralised per-user credentials, and exposes a React SPA for self
onboarding + collaborative markdown editing + admin/usage analytics.

The full plan lives at **`docs/PLAN.md`**. Read it first.

## What runs where

- **Cloudflare Worker** (`apps/worker/`) is the single deployable unit. It
  hosts: the MCP server (`/mcp`, `/sse`), the OAuth provider (`/oauth/*`,
  `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`), REST endpoints for the SPA
  (`/api/*`), IdP callbacks (`/idp/*`), the realtime collab endpoint
  (`/collab/:id`), and the React SPA via Workers Assets.
- **React SPA** (`apps/web/`) is built with Vite and shipped from
  `apps/web/dist` by the Worker.
- **Shared types** (`packages/shared/`) — Zod schemas + types used by both
  Worker and SPA.

## Architecture pointers

- MCP per-session state → Durable Object `McpSessionDO`
  (`apps/worker/src/mcp/session-do.ts`).
- Per-doc realtime collab → Durable Object `DocRoomDO`
  (`apps/worker/src/collab/doc-room-do.ts`).
- Stdio upstreams run as Daytona Cloud sandboxes per `(user, upstream)`,
  fronted by a stdio↔HTTP bridge (`supergateway`). HTTP/SSE upstreams are
  proxied directly. See `apps/worker/src/upstream/daytona.ts` (M4).
- All sensitive material is sealed with AES-GCM via `crypto/aead.ts`.

## How a Claude session should work in this repo

1. The SessionStart hook in `.claude/settings.json` runs
   `bun install --frozen-lockfile`.
2. Use the slash commands in `.claude/commands/`:
   - `/smoke` — deploy a preview + hit smoke endpoints + print a status table.
   - `/migrate` — apply pending D1 migrations.
   - `/seed` — load fixture upstreams + docs into local D1.
   - `/snapshot <slug>` — rebuild a single Daytona snapshot (M4+).
   - `/deploy:preview` — deploy a versioned preview and print the URL.
3. Before pushing: `bun run verify` (typecheck + tests + smoke).

## Conventions

- Module size cap: ~200 LoC. Split when it grows.
- One folder = one concern. No circular imports across `apps/worker/src/*`.
- All env access goes through the typed `env.ts` — never `process.env`.
- D1 queries live in `apps/worker/src/db/queries/*.ts`; route handlers stay
  SQL-free.
- Hono routes are tiny; logic lives in helpers under the sibling concern
  folder.
- Every workspace declares stubs for `typecheck` / `lint` / `test` even if
  they just `echo`. `bun --filter='*' run X` silently skips workspaces
  missing the script, so the stubs are the only thing keeping cross-cuts
  honest.
- Don't write new docs/README files unless asked. Update `docs/PLAN.md`.

## Architectural gotchas baked into M1

These all bit us during the scaffold review; do NOT re-introduce them.
Full rationale in `docs/PLAN.md` Section G.

- **SQLite/D1**: no expressions allowed in `PRIMARY KEY`. Use a `''`
  sentinel on `NOT NULL` columns and a partial `UNIQUE INDEX` for
  "at most one nullable-value row" invariants. Every enum-shaped column
  has a matching `CHECK (col IN (...))`.
- **Workers Assets SPA fallback**: lives in `[assets]
  not_found_handling = "single-page-application"`, NOT in a hand-rolled
  `app.notFound`. `run_worker_first` lists both bare and glob forms
  (`/mcp` + `/mcp/*`).
- **Durable Objects**: stubs use `new_classes`, not
  `new_sqlite_classes` (storage backend is sticky once chosen).
- **Worker entry**: typed as `ExportedHandler<Env>` so `queue` and
  `scheduled` get the right `ctx` / controller types. Queue dispatcher
  retries on unknown queue names instead of silently dropping.
- **SPA auth flow**: distinguish `ApiError(401)` from `ApiSchemaError`
  in `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`. Treating schema failures as auth
  failures causes redirect loops.
- **Bun lockfile**: `bun install --frozen-lockfile` silently installs
  without a lockfile. SessionStart hook tests for `bun.lock` first.
- **Wrangler preview**: `wrangler versions upload` (the
  `--x-versions` flag was retired in wrangler 4).
- **`apps/web/dist`**: must exist for `wrangler dev`/`deploy`.
  `scripts/ensure-dist.mjs` lays a placeholder via `predev`/`prebuild`/
  `predeploy` hooks in `apps/worker/package.json`.
- **`seed:remote`** is a separate command from `seed:local` — never let
  `seed.mjs` default to remote.

## Org information architecture

Each install serves one org. Inside the org we model **teams** (who people
belong to) and **products** (what the org delivers). Defaults are "spread
context, gate execution":

- Docs are open-read by everyone signed in. Tags on docs (team / product /
  topic) shape what `search_docs` returns by default — they do not gate
  read access.
- MCP upstreams are invisible until an admin grants visibility to a team
  or product. `list_upstreams` only returns what the user can use.

## Where to start

Milestones live in `docs/PLAN.md` under "Milestone breakdown". Current state:
**M1 + M2 closed (May 2026).** Real RAG validated end-to-end: Claude (Web)
DCR + OAuth handshake → `whoami`/`list_my_context`/`search_docs`/`get_doc`
against real Vectorize, with orphan-vector cleanup via `chunk_count`
tracking verified by shrink test.
M1: Google/GitHub sign-in.
M2a: per-doc ACL (`0005_doc_acl.sql`), `__Host-ctx_csrf` + middleware,
`/api/docs` REST + content save, `/api/docs/:id/editors`,
`/api/users?email=`, BlockNote editor with sharing + creator/editor
attribution + inline title rename + import-markdown + doc-to-doc
links + roadmapper theme. M2b/1: reindex pipeline in
`apps/worker/src/rag/{markdown,chunker,embedder,index}.ts`; Workers
AI `@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5`; Vectorize upsert logged-only with
M2c idempotency contract documented inline. M2b/2: `doc_tags`
queries + `/api/docs/:id/tags` + `/api/teams` + `/api/products` +
full admin CRUD at `/api/admin/teams|products|team-products`, SPA
tag pane in editor right rail, `/app/admin/teams` +
`/app/admin/products` pages (create/edit/delete + team-members
drawer + team↔product matrix), reindex consumer reads `doc_tags`
into chunk metadata, tag changes enqueue a fresh reindex,
`seed.mjs` seeds 3 teams + 2 products.
M2c: `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` mounts OAuth at /oauth/*
+ /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server. /oauth/authorize renders
a minimal SSR'd IdP chooser; IdP callbacks fork between SPA-cookie
and `provider.completeAuthorization(props)` based on
`oauth_request_id`. McpSessionDO extends `McpAgent` from `agents`
SDK (SQLite-backed v2 migration); registers `whoami`,
`list_my_context`, `list_upstreams`, `get_doc`, `search_docs` (embed
+ Vectorize query + scope post-filter). Doc resources at
`mcp://ctxlayer/docs/{id}`. Reindex now writes to real Vectorize
with `chunk_count` tracking (migration 0006) so orphans get deleted
when revisions shrink.

**Local dev** (sign-in, docs CRUD, sharing, tags, admin pages):
`bun run dev` from a fresh checkout. The reindex consumer
soft-skips Vectorize in dev so saves don't drop after retries;
`search_docs` returns nothing locally because no vectors land —
that's expected.

**End-to-end RAG validation** (search_docs hitting real Vectorize)
requires a real deploy. `wrangler dev --remote` is NOT a viable
shortcut — it emits "Queues are not yet supported in wrangler dev
remote mode" + "SQLite in Durable Objects is only supported in local
mode" warnings, and SPA routes 503 because the McpSessionDO can't
boot SQLite-backed in that mode. Go straight to deploy:

1. `wrangler login`
2. `bun run bootstrap` — provisions D1/KV/R2/Vectorize + queues, patches wrangler.toml
3. `bun run migrate:remote`
4. `wrangler secret put` for each: `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECRET`, `ALLOWED_GITHUB_USERS`, `ADMIN_EMAILS` (add Google equivalents if using Google). `ALLOWED_*` and `ADMIN_EMAILS` are intentionally not declared in `[vars]` because a `[vars]` declaration with the same name blocks `wrangler secret put`.
5. `bun run seed:remote`
6. First `bun run deploy` — prints the `*.workers.dev` URL.
7. Patch `[vars] PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to that URL, swap the GitHub OAuth app's callback URL to `<URL>/idp/github/callback`, `bun run deploy` again.
8. Wire Claude (Web/Desktop) with `{"mcpServers": {"ctxlayer": {"url": "<URL>/mcp"}}}`.

For local dev to keep working with the workers.dev URL committed
to `wrangler.toml`, put `PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://localhost:8787`
in `.dev.vars` to override `[vars]`.

The full done-done checklist lives in `docs/PLAN.md` under the M2
verification entry.

Next work after M2 closes: **M3 (Yjs realtime collab)** then **M4
(upstream proxy + Daytona)** then **M5 (admin UI)** then **M6
(usage + dashboards)**.

Local dev runs over HTTPS (mkcert; first `bun run dev` provisions
`.dev-tls/`). The `__Host-ctx_session` cookie carries an HMAC-signed
`{userId, role, iat, exp}` body keyed by `SESSION_COOKIE_SECRET`; the
sibling `__Host-ctx_oauth_state` cookie carries the redirect-dance
state. See Section G11–G12 in `docs/PLAN.md` for full rationale.
