# ctxlayer — Claude Code Briefing

This repo is the **agent context layer**: a remote MCP server on Cloudflare that
serves curated docs (with RAG over Vectorize), proxies upstream MCP servers
with centralised per-user credentials, and exposes a React SPA for self
onboarding + collaborative markdown editing + admin/usage analytics.

The full plan lives at **`docs/PLAN.md`**. Read it first.

## What runs where

- **Cloudflare Worker** (`apps/worker/`) is the single deployable unit. It
  hosts: the MCP server (`/mcp`, `/sse`), the OAuth provider (`/oauth/*`,
  `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`), REST endpoints for the SPA
  (`/api/*`), IdP callbacks (`/idp/*`), the realtime collab endpoint
  (`/collab/:id`), and the React SPA via Workers Assets.
- **React SPA** (`apps/web/`) is built with Vite and shipped from
  `apps/web/dist` by the Worker.
- **Shared types** (`packages/shared/`) — Zod schemas + types used by both
  Worker and SPA.

## Architecture pointers

- MCP per-session state → Durable Object `McpSessionDO`
  (`apps/worker/src/mcp/session-do.ts`).
- Per-doc realtime collab → Durable Object `DocRoomDO`
  (`apps/worker/src/collab/doc-room-do.ts`).
- Stdio upstreams run as Daytona Cloud sandboxes per `(user, upstream)`,
  fronted by a stdio↔HTTP bridge (`supergateway`). HTTP/SSE upstreams are
  proxied directly. See `apps/worker/src/upstream/daytona.ts` (M4).
- All sensitive material is sealed with AES-GCM via `crypto/aead.ts`.

## How a Claude session should work in this repo

1. The SessionStart hook in `.claude/settings.json` runs
   `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
2. Use the slash commands in `.claude/commands/`:
   - `/smoke` — deploy a preview + hit smoke endpoints + print a status table.
   - `/migrate` — apply pending D1 migrations.
   - `/seed` — load fixture upstreams + docs into local D1.
   - `/snapshot <slug>` — rebuild a single Daytona snapshot (M4+).
   - `/deploy:preview` — deploy a versioned preview and print the URL.
3. Before pushing: `pnpm verify` (typecheck + tests + smoke).

## Conventions

- Module size cap: ~200 LoC. Split when it grows.
- One folder = one concern. No circular imports across `apps/worker/src/*`.
- All env access goes through the typed `env.ts` — never `process.env`.
- D1 queries live in `apps/worker/src/db/queries/*.ts`; route handlers stay
  SQL-free.
- Hono routes are tiny; logic lives in helpers under the sibling concern
  folder.
- Don't write new docs/README files unless asked. Update `docs/PLAN.md`.

## Where to start

Milestones live in `docs/PLAN.md` under "Milestone breakdown". Current state:
**M1 skeleton scaffolded, no auth wired yet.** Next work to do is M1's
sign-in leg (Google + GitHub IdP + allowlist + `/api/me`).
